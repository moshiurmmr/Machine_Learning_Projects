This project builds machine learning models for the very well known Titanic si data set, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

The goal of the model is to predict the survival probability of the passengers given their name, sex, age, ticket, fare, cabin, place of
embarkment, passenger class, etc.

1. The data is available in the 'titanic_data' folder
2. Data preprocessing: a number of data preprocessing operation have been carried out to select the more relevant features for the modeling purpose. 
    i. data having unique features is removed using the function, 'removeUniqueFeature.py'. The reason is, if the the data unique for all the training samples for a particular feature, there is no useful correlation information for the feaute, hence, the entropy is null. This type of data is not useful, so they are removed.
